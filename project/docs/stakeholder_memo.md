# Stakeholder Memo — Retirement Portfolio Risk Alignment

**Audience:** Advisors serving risk-averse retirees  
**Problem:** Portfolios often exceed client risk tolerance because high-volatility assets creep in over time or during rallies.  

**What we will deliver:**  
- An overview of the current portfolio performance and asset breakdown
- A daily “Risk Alignment” snapshot showing:  
    - % of high-volatility holdings vs. policy target  
    - Realized 60-day volatility, Max Drawdown, and 1-day/10-day VaR
- Flag noticeable assets that have high volatility or dramatic drawdown.

**How advisors will use it:**  
- Review dashboards during quarterly check-ins or after major market moves.  

**Limits & notes:** Educational prototype; not individualized advice. Data quality checks and policy thresholds are configurable.
